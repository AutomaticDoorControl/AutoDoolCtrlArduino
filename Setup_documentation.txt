How to setup arduino:

1. In order to see how to wire up the arduino: look at ADC_circuit.png or look at
2. RTC and HC-08 documentation to see would those are specifically setup
3. First set up the time to the RTC by uploading RTC.ino to the arduino and setting the current time in the code
4. Next you might want to rename the HC-08 so you can add it to the API. The code rename.ino can help with renaming the HC-08 module
5. Last step is to upload the TOTP_ADC code and select the correct key for the specific door
